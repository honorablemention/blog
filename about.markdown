# Author
I'm Steven Schultz, a software engineer with a passion for crafting experiences that delight users.

My interests include software development, functional programming techniques, and visual and interaction design.

This blog's posts will largely be technical but my goal is to bring context to those topics to help explain why on earth any of it matters. I expect to maintain a core topic list of software development practices, coding, and design. 

# Name
The "WorkWrite" name is simply a title for this set of thoughts I am setting out forth to capture. Below the surface it is a (poor) portmanteau of "work right" (sic, "work correctly") and "work. write." -  a simple mantra that I hope helps me build a consistent routine of posting - "work, then write."
